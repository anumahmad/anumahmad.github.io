      <h1>hi, <u>anum</u> here!</h1>
      <p>i'm a recent graduate from <u>barnard college of columbia university</u>, <br> where i studied computer science on a combination major
        track with education studies. <br> </p>  
        <p> 
          <br>
          <br>
            i run a substack with a friend from university called <u>office hours!</u> - feel free to check it out <a href="https://anumkyraoh.substack.com/" target="_blank">here</a>!
          <br> 
          <br>
           i learned to code in 2018, during a free two week summer camp for girls called <u>Kode with Klossy</u>. <br> later on, i also went on to work for the organization as a teaching assistant and curriculum developer. i spoke about my experience on CBS Morning News, which you can check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CBSMornings/videos/after-attending-kode-with-klossy-camps-anum-ahmad-is-now-studying-to-become-a-so/540466414558521/" target="_blank">here</a>! 
          
           <br> <br>
          my time there inspired me to pursue a career in tech, and i went on to win hackathons around the east coast and eventually orgnanize ones myself at school! in particular, i am very interested in combining my passion for education with technology to create impactful learning experiences through code.
         <br> <br>
         outside of my tech interests, i love to read, drink bubble tea, and constantly work on my english and arabic calligraphy :)
